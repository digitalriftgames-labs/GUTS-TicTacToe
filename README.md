# Tic Tac Toe (GUTS Module)
A complete Tic Tac Toe implementation built using the GUTS architecture.
This module includes a pure C# engine for all gameplay logic and an optional Unity demo that showcases UI, SFX, and VFX using an event‑driven presentation layer.

## Architecture Overview
- **Engine Layer:** Pure C# implementation of rules, turn flow, and board state.
- **Presentation Layer:** Unity demo that listens to engine events and updates UI, SFX, and VFX. 
- **Separation of Concerns:** Gameplay logic is fully independent of Unity.
